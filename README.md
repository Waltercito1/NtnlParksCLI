# Ntional Parks Command Line Interface (CLI)
First portfolio project for Flatiron (102020 - ONL - SE - PT)

Welcome to the National Park CLI. This program allows the user to see a list of every national park in the United States in alphabetical order or by state. The user can then choose the index associated with a park to find out more information about it (ie: park description, notes on how to get to the park, and the park's hours of operation).

## Installation

And then execute:
