# Ntional Parks Command Line Interface (CLI)
First portfolio project for Flatiron (102020 - ONL - SE - PT)

Welcome to the National Parks CLI. This program allows the user to see a list of every national park in the United States in alphabetical order or by state. The user can then choose the index associated with a park to find out more information about it (ie: park description, notes on how to get to the park, and the park's hours of operation).

## Installation
Fork and clone this repository and cd into the directory.

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage
Enter 'bin/nps' in your terminal to run the program. Once the program has finished loading all National Parks data you will be prompted to select '1', '2', or 'exit' in the main menu. Press '1' to view an alphabetical list of all National Parks in the United States listed 25 parks at the time for your convenience. You will have  the option to select 'c' to continue loading parks names, type 'exit' to return to the main menu, or type the index number associated with the park you would like to know more about. The choice is yours!
Additionally from the main menu, you could press '2' and enter the abbreviation of a state to get a list of all the National Parks in that state. From there you could type the index number associated with the park you would like to know more about or type 'exit' to return to the main menu.
Have fun!
